# ðŸ“ˆ Stroke Prediction

According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.

This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

## Why did I choose this dataset?

A popular dataset where I can implement machine learning classification algorithms.

## What was my aim and did I succeed?

Instead of creating and sharing a few standard ML models, I wanted to wrote a function as detailed as I could and tried to provide ease of processing with many parameters. 

The algorithm works as far as I've tested. If bugs are reported via feedback, I will work on it.

## What could I have done better ? (TO-DO)

* In this notebook, I could not make a detailed visualization or EDA because I only worked on the "Compare Algorithms Function". Therefore, I will work on EDA and visualization


## What did I learn from this analysis?
* The algorithm has 15 parameters. and while working on this algorithm, I learned many metrics and methods thanks to these parameters. (SMOTE, Feature Importance, Score Metrics, K-Fold, etc..)
